I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults, through experiential methodologies.

I believe that school kills creativity, self-esteem, and most importantly, sensitivity in individuals, which has larger implications on society.

I am passionate about co-creating learning journeys with young adults, fostering safe, dialogic spaces, sharing reflective tools, and inviting them for [‘self-directed learning’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoE480mzrk0).

*This includes:*

Facilitating theatre and outdoor/nature-based experiential learning programs, projects, residential camps, yatra, internships, weekly meetups, and more.

With a decade of experience, I consult for a number of learning spaces across India.

At times, I engage in educational content, curriculum, and product development. While it's not always fun or meaningful, I appreciate the creative process and the opportunity to apply my experience with children and teachers.

As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays for children. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.

When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.

Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.
