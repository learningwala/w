### About me : 

Hi, This is Mihir Pathak aka learningwala

I am passionate educator. 

I never been to formal school after completing 10th grade. Later, I completed my 12th grade and pursued a BA in Sociology as an external student. I am working with children since the age of 18. 

Instead of going to school, I spent time exploring website & software development, sales & marketing, theater, writing, design, technology, entrepreneurship and many more interests.

I started working with children through sharing how to use computer, exploring ['MIT Scratch'](https://scratch.mit.edu/) , making [Arvind Gupta toys](https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/), telling stories, playing games and more.

**Slowly after lots of experimentation I realized that :**

- I like being with children & young adults, I can be my self.

- and I can do creative experiments & explorations with them, which I can't do in school or university.

I started volunteering in different schools, meeting inspiring, passionate educators and children, visited different learning spaces across India, read books & attended workshops.

And that’s how my journey started as an educator, which is evolving every day.

During this decade long journey, I worked in a formal & informal learning spaces across india. Did friendship with many children & educators.

**I create transformative learning journeys for children, young adults and educators using experiential methodologies, including theater, nature-based explorations, and interdisciplinary projects.**

My programs, workshops and intervention are just an anchor. My strong intention is to create a space of healing, acceptance, and co-creation.

A space which act as an incubation center for everyone.Where we learn, experiment, challenge ourselves, and thereby break barriers and grow in our lives. 

**My current core interest areas are** 

- Understanding the role of love & Relationship in education
- Self directed learning & non formal learning spaces 
- Child development & learning
- Language pedagogy and children literature
- Life skills education and ecological consciousness / nature education

My work is deeply inspired by the philosophies of [J. Krishnamurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti), [Martin Buber](https://infed.org/mobi/martin-buber-on-education/) , and the science of brain, learning, and child development. 

I am part of the faculty team for the ['Child Development, Learning & Special Needs'](https://www.eklavya.in/about-us-eklavya/what-we-do-eklavya-new/courses-and-workshops/child-development-special-needs-and-learning-a-certificate-course) course at Eklavya Foundation, Bhopal. And a proud recipient of the Earth Educator Fellowship (2022-23), supported by the [Youth Conservation Action Network](https://www.youcan.in/).

As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.

When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.

Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.
