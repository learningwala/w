![Mihir Pathak](/mp-about.png)

I am a passionate educator, working with children, young adults, and fellow educators for the last 11 years. 

I create transformative learning journeys using experiential methodologies, including theater, nature-based explorations, and interdisciplinary projects.

My work is deeply inspired by the philosophies of [J. Krishnamurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti), [Martin Buber](https://infed.org/mobi/martin-buber-on-education/) , and the science of brain, learning, and child development. 

I focus on building [genuine relationships with children](http://21stcenturylearners.org.uk/?p=1297), fostering [life skills](https://www.unicef.org/india/media/2571/file/Comprehensive-lifeskills-framework.pdf), [ecological consciousness](https://www.dunami-somatics.com/post/ecological-consciousness-and-awareness), and exploring the [Panchkosha model of human development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosha).

I am part of the core team for the ['Child Development, Learning & Special Needs'](https://www.eklavya.in/about-us-eklavya/what-we-do-eklavya-new/courses-and-workshops/child-development-special-needs-and-learning-a-certificate-course) course at Eklavya Foundation and a proud recipient of the Earth Educator Fellowship (2022-23), supported by the [Youth Conservation Action Network](https://www.youcan.in/).
