![Mihir Pathak](/mp-about.png)

I am passionate educator working in a formal and informal learning environments for the past 11 years. 

**I craft transformative learning journeys with children and young adults through experiential methodologies:**

My offerings :

- Project based learning programs
- Movement & Theater based programs
- Nature / Outdoor based programs

- Workshops, Residential camps, Yatras, Internships, Weekly meetups, 
- Developing informal learning spaces (Clubs, Maker Space, Library, Studio).
- Mentorship for 'self design learning' programs (fellowships / Passion Projects)

With a decade of experience, I consult for a number of learning spaces across India.

At times, I engage in educational content, curriculum, and product development. While it's not always fun or meaningful, I appreciate the creative process and the opportunity to apply my experience of working with children and teachers.

As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays for children. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.

When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.

Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.
