I believe that modern education system is a fraudulent system of learning, whose purpose is to convert beautiful diverse human beings into robot-like "human resources" and into stupid global consumers.

**I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults.**

> In contemporary societies, we must learn to negotiate and act on our own purposes, values, feelings, and meanings rather than those we have uncritically assimilated from others — to gain greater control over our lives as socially responsible, clearthinking decision makers.(Mezirow, 2012).

**I believe that transformative learning happens through human relationships, dialogs, powerful experiences & reflections.**

> Transformative learning is the expansion of consciousness through the transformation of basic worldview and specific capacities of the self. (Elias, 1997)

**I am passionate about co-creating dialogic spaces with children & young adults. 
Where we share creative adventures, tools for reflection, and we embark on 'journey of growth'.**

> Learning does not happen through teaching; it happens through meeting. — Martin Buber

**Intention to action :**

I am trying to facilitate transformative learning through tools I have discovered during my journey :

- Interdisciplinary projects / Project based learning (Creative writing, Entrepreneurship, Civic-Environment, Coding - Designing - inquiry based projects)
- Movement & Theater based programs
- Nature / Outdoor based programs

Residential camps, Yatras, Internships, Weekly meetups, developing informal learning spaces (Clubs, Maker Space, Library, Studio).
Engaging with transformational programs like Fellowships and more.

With a decade of experience, I consult for a number of learning spaces across India.

----------

At times, I engage in educational content, curriculum, and product development. While it's not always fun or meaningful, I appreciate the creative process and the opportunity to apply my experience of working with children and teachers.

As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays for children. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.

When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.

Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.
