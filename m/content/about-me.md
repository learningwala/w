**I craft transformative learning journeys with children and young adults through experiential methodologies:**

I am working with children, young adults and educators since last 11 years. I have worked with a formal & informal learning spaces during this journey. 

My core interest is developing life skills & environmental consciousnesses through theater, outdoor & interdisciplinary project based transformative experiences.

I also work with teenagers as companion in their self directed journey / gap year

Inspired from the philosophy of J.Krishnmurti, Martin Buber & science of child development I work with educators to help them to create transformative learning experiences in their context/learning spaces.

When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.

Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.
