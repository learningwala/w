Hi, This is Mihir Pathak aka learningwala

I am passionate educator. 

I never been to formal school after completing 10th grade. Later, I completed my 12th grade and pursued a BA in Sociology as an external student. I am working with children since the age of 18. 

During this decade long journey, I worked in a formal & informal learning spaces. Worked with children directly, shared my understanding of education and pedagogy with teachers, developed content, curricula & more. 

My core interests areas are understanding 'The role of love & Relationship in education', Self directed learning & non formal learning spaces, Child development & learning, language pedagogy and children literature, life skills education and ecological consciousness / nature education.

My work is deeply inspired by the philosophies of [J. Krishnamurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti), [Martin Buber](https://infed.org/mobi/martin-buber-on-education/) , and the science of brain, learning, and child development. 

**I create transformative learning journeys for children, young adults and educators using experiential methodologies, including theater, nature-based explorations, and interdisciplinary projects.**

I am part of the faculty team for the ['Child Development, Learning & Special Needs'](https://www.eklavya.in/about-us-eklavya/what-we-do-eklavya-new/courses-and-workshops/child-development-special-needs-and-learning-a-certificate-course) course at Eklavya Foundation, Bhopal. and a proud recipient of the Earth Educator Fellowship (2022-23), supported by the [Youth Conservation Action Network](https://www.youcan.in/).

As an amateur writer, I enjoy crafting poetry and aspire to write stories, poems, and plays for children. So far, I have self-published two books in Gujarati.

When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.

Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.
