I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults,
through **Nature - Project - Theater based experiential methodologies**.

I believe that sharing one's passion, providing reflective tools to children, and fostering an environment for dialogue and self-directed learning can be truly transformative.

**I am interested in :**

- Nature / Climate Education
- Interdisciplinary Project based - self directed - Experiential Learning
- Life Skills and Socio Emotional Learning
- Dialogue based - Transformative learning
- Mentoring teenagers for designing their own learning Journeys & making portfolio
- Citizen science - open data - civic engagement projects, 
- Creative writing - art - theater - design and technology
- Informal learning environment (Library, Maker Space, Studio, Club, Yatra, Camp, Festival)

With decade of experience I consult for a number of alternative educational institutions across India.

When I'm not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my 'learning experiments' with children.

Music, Long walks, Bird watching, singing and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.
