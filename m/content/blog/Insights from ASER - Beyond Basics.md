Recently I read the [ASER ‘Byond Basics’](https://asercentre.org/aser-2023-beyond-basics/) report. It is all about young adults age 14 to 18yrs 


*   Do they have technology access / smart phone 
    
*   What are their aspirations 
    
*   Can they read and do basic maths 
    

All these questions will give a window to a world of possibilities. How are they using smartphones and for what purpose ? Do they use it for learning ? If not, how can we encourage them to do that?

*   Smartphones are a great equlazirer but contentwise we are competing with youtube. 
    
*   What type of content we should publish in this situation 
    
*   Can we ask youth what they want?
    
*   How are you looking at learning happening outside the school ?
    

These all are questions to the window of possibilities. I read the report and some other articles. I am writing some insights which I got reflecting on them. 

*   We need to have dialgue with youth about what they want 
    
*   Only creating content and putting it in the air will not work, we need to make the whole ecosystem of learning.
    
*   We can blame or expect schools to teach everything we need to look at the needs of this age group outside the school structure. 
    
*   We need to create informal learning spaces where young people can come, talk, and explore freely. (The youth wants a space to share their feelings, anxieties, and fears about the future.)
    
*   Second step can be nudging them for some learning - challenging activities where smartphones or technology can play a bigger role. But that one on one connect, guidance, mentorship is important 
    

Let’s take one scenario : 

You started one youth program where young people join and teach children. Through this program you started one ‘youth adda’ where young people can come freely to talk - hangout. 

Slowly you made genuine friendship with them, now they are open for your ideas and guidance.

You suggested they do one short course on ‘financial literacy’ so they can manage their finances well. Now high quilty content is important.

Youtube is winning because it is no brainer. You don’t need to think to see insta reels or youtube shots. You need brain, motivation and many other factors to see ‘learning content’

*   One way is, make your learning content in format of shots and influncere kind of videos. Like Vlogs and more. There are chances that you need to dilute your content to add those types of mirch masala.
    
*   Second way is to build an ecosystem which encourages and nudges us to explore ‘learning content’ apart from those nobrainers.
    

Let’s talk about Ankur wariku. He is making videos on financial literacy. Apart from making videos he is doing insta live with people to help them to learn ‘how to invest in their given salary’

*   He is building a community. 
    
*   He is taking subjects which very very relevant to young people 
    

I believe we need to do both things in balance. We need to make our content more engaging and on the other side we need to build an ecosystem around it. 

There are some more insights about vocational training and basic reading and maths 

Which I will write some other time.
