#### 19th to 25th Jan 2025 (Sunday to Saturday)

- Sunday : Mostly spent time in reading weekly notes from different people. I found out [blog ring](https://thejeshgn.com/projects/blogring/) developed by [Thejesh GN](https://thejeshgn.com) where he saved URLs of blogs with weekly notes. He also mentioned some new names of weekly note writers in his recent [note](https://thejeshgn.com/2025/01/17/weekly-notes-03-2025/). I got know about wonderful work of [Adhavan Sivaraj](https://adhavansivaraj.xyz) from the weekly note section. 

- Monday : Worked on khojbeen logo myself, Antara wrote khojbeen by hand and sent a photo. I used that photo and tried to make something on canva. I was very much impressed by the logo ALT EFF so I used background color of that. [Aditya](https://adityadipankar.com/) gave some ideas.
