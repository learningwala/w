- 5th, 6th : home
- 7th : shopping, came to nidhi's place
- 8th : gave interview to Anushree in the morning 
- 9th : Sakha lunch meeting. We (Ashish bhai, Rameshwari ben, Nikita ben, Saurabh bhai, Nidhi, Mihir sajid bhai ) went to kathivadi darbar. it was super fun.
evening - went to gajra cafe (Anushree, Nidhi, Mihir). It was fun to rome around in old city. Eating raju patti samosa..


10th : Bharat and dhara came. We again went to gajara cafe, ate pavbhaji near sursagar..

they were student of alternative school near rajkot / chotila calle 'K shala'. I use to do BA sociology from surastra university around 2017. During that time I use to visit this school. Bharat came to my place when I was working in Bhuj. I was so happy to see them after so many years. Our relationship was not like teacher - students. We are friends. I am so happy that they are now working with children and trying to create environment which they got during k shala. They also shared the updates about other students that they are doing well in their respective fields and some of them are getting married soon.

Nikunj is not doing anything as per them :)
Deepak is working in factory 
Harshad is interested in mountaineering and he is working as guide for different groups 

Bharat and Dhara are going to work at shishukunj foundation, Bhuj. They are going to work with children from gov schools. Me & Nidhi were thinking to visit them and do some nature education work with them. I felt that they are thinking limited scope of work like doing games and art activity with children. We can do lot more. We will talk to them. I it just thought, I never seen them working so I might be wrong.
