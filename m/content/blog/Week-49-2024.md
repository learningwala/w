#### 30th to 7th Dec 2024 (Saturday to Saturday )


1st Dec : we (Mihir, Nidhi and Mitali ben) met jagdish bhai (donor of kanisa school)
2nd Dec : spent time with Nidhi at her place. We went for a brunch at Cafe Bangalore. We mostly talked about the Job and future of our work.

at this point we have few opportunities :

We have eliminated these :

- creative school and other alternative schools in BLR
- Moving to Cooore / Joining youcan 

Current options :

- Project DEFY and BeMe (Bangalore)
- Balgokulam 
- Vapi home schooling group 
- getting funds and work at Mitali ben's place 
- going to bhopal, find out some work at Eklavya 
- Shishukunj, Bhuj 
- varun khimani jashdan - gopaldham learning center 

right now we both are feeling that Bangalore option is great financially and growth wise 
but my family (specifically father) wants that we stay in Vadodra and do work here. We are feeling helpless. 
we want to be near to our parents but other side there is a financial struggle, we will not get money in Vadodara. 
we can definitely do good work if we get funding. let's how it goes.

- 4th to 7th dec - APU - Wipro Partners Forum 2024
