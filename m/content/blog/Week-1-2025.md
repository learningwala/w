- I wrote [2024 reflections](https://learningwala.in/blog/2024-reflections/)
- Worked on sakha fellowship program design 
- My health went down, fever, low blood pressure 
- people are going to come to write kankotri at home on 5th Jan so did prep for that 
- I did calculation of all funding and other money I have and how much I utilize in what. 
	Didn't get proper calculation for salary money (money apart from grant).
