- Rameshwari ben took first session with children 'Vadodra Water Walks'

We kick started our journey of 'Ecobuddy Summer Program' with 20 teenage children from Sai's angel foundation, Vadodara.

The program contains three broad areas :



- Biodiversity around you
- Water body (Vishwamitri River)
- Climate and consumption.

In the first session, children got connected to their environment through nature walk, nature bingo, nature journaling and tree meditation

Thank you @a_naturalists_column for writing wonderful piece of meditation. We have translated the tree meditation in Hindi and Gujarati.
