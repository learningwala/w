#### 1st to 8th March 2025 (Saturday to Saturday)

- Week was super hectic, new job, new home, new city :)
- Me and Nidhi are slowly settling down here in ahemdabad. 
- We came here on 29th and I joined new workplace from 3rd March. so we got some time to settle the our stuff, figure out breakfast, lunch places,vegetable - fruit vendors, bought some grocery - kitchen utensils. living in big city is difficult. If I stay in vadodra I can go to mangal bazar or local market of padra and get the stuff. Here it was difficult to find out local market. You need to surrender to places like Dmart or blinkit. I am very very grateful to Nidhi, she did all the setup for kitchen, rooms.. made the place homelike. 
- during Saturday and Sunday :
  - I watched amazing documentary called '[Chaar Phool Hain Aur Duniya Hai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiL4ply2f44)' based on [Vinod Kumar Shukla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Kumar_Shukla)'s life & work.
  - Went to Navjeevan Trust Campus after long time. Explored their new book store called 'Hridaykunj'. Got 2 new books. Banaras Dairy by Vivek Desai (English translation), Electric Train (Gujarati) by Geeta Nayak. Both the books were in my list to buy from long time. I bought banaras dairy in english so Nidhi can also read. She is from UP but never get chance to visit banaras, now a days she is making efforts to know and connect with her city - state. I was keen to read banaras dairy in gujarati, I was in doubt if I will understand and feel the content in english or not. Nidhi did loud reading of one of chapters. It was good... I can visualize.. accept when some unknown words come in.. 
  - We also had dinner at 'Karma Cafe' at Navjeevan Trust Campus. 
  
- Work is going well. We have young energetic - learning oriented team. I will need some more time to figure out transport. My office is 12km away from home. Right now I using repido bike service. Everyday I am meeting new new characters of repido bike drivers. I will write about it in detail on some other day. For coming back I take lift from team members.. papa bought second hand activa for us, it is in vadodra right now. We need to figure out how to bring that here.
- on saturday 8th march me & nidhi completed one month of our marriage. Nidhi's mom reminded us :) most of the time we forget that we are "married". Nidhi order noodles and choco lava to celebrate the moment.
- Nidhi's dadaji got admitted in hospital for second time in last 15 days. on saturday late night, nidhi took flight for Lucknow to visit home.
