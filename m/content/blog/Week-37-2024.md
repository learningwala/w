one girl got accedent there, so nidhi got occupied with that - XRay and other things.. I took session 'khoji club' I have praposed two ideas 

1. I will give seed money of 2k, start your own venture 
2. tell me whcih skills you want to learn / what project you want to do 

most of the children opted for skill thing - cooking, music, art, computer programming, stock market, pet care and more
I am so happy to see children's enthusism. Now we need to find resources for them.
