#### From 19th May to 25th May

- I took a session on 'Futurology' with children at Ramkrishna Mission. It was a different experience to work with children at Mission.
I have a very different connection with RKM. I used to visit that place during my days in Vadodara (around 2010 to 2013 / 14)

took one in person and online session. 4 teams are made and children are working on 4 different projects.
