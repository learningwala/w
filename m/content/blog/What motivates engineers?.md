I was listening to a podcast from Scaler called ScalerPod. Where they interview CTOs from different startups. They ask about their journey, challenges and how their typical day looks like.

Till now I have seen two episodes.

Kalish Nadh (CTO, Zerodha)
Jacob Singh (CTO in Residence for Sequoia Capital in South East Asia and India)

I like both the episodes so much. Apart from tech both the episodes were filled with philosophies. Here I would like to share one thought shared by Jacob about motivation for the work. 

He shared that intrinsic motivation for work comes from three things : 

- Autonomy 

- Mastry 

- Connectedness / Purpose
