#### 10th Feb to 14th Feb 2025 (Monday to Friday)

Nothing much happened in this week.

- Me & Nidhi came back from Kanpur. Our train was late for 4.5hrs 
- our family was prepared for Gruhpravesh ritual. It was fun.
- During the wedding function some family conflicts happened. So there is tension in the home environment
- Me and Nidhi decided to move ahemdabd. I accepted the offer letter from balgokulam. They are doing research in early childhood education, I will be working directly with children, curriculum designers and researchers. They are focusing on nature education in kindergarten. let's see how it goes.

Nidhi is still looking for work opportunity. We trying to find some nature education related org. We need org which allow us to work with children through nature education / project based learning. She got some personal grant so no need for job but she need space to work. 

we will be visiting ahemdabad from 17th to 19th. I will visit balgokulam and Nidhi will meet orgs where she can volunteer. 

1. Jeevan Teerth, Koba
2. Planet Discovery, Thaltej 

we are also figuring out the place to stay & other essential stuff.
