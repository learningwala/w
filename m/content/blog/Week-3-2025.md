Me and Nidhi are thinking about giving proper name and visual identity to our nature education work. Learningwala is there but nidhi is feeling that, it is my brand and my work, she is not feeling that she is part of it. So we have decided to create something new which we both can hold and nurture. 

I was thinking about different names.. KhojBeen Mandali suck to my mind. Nidhi also liked it. I started reaching out to people seeking help in visual identity. Rachita called me and gave some ideas about how to start. I had a chat with Ipsa Jain, Ashra, Nipun Prabhakar, Jinal, Chaitali and few other folks about the same.

**Overall mood and other things**

- Overall I am happy. Work at DEFY is going well. 
- I am happy that my and nidhi's friends are coming to our wedding 
- After eliminating all the options we have decided to go to [Mitali ben's school](https://www.ntpatelhighschool.org/) from march. [Gopaldham](https://gopaldham.org/) option is still open, today morning I had call with Varun. He is ready to accommodate both of us with salary we are expecting. The only thing is it is very remote area and we will feel alone. Here mitali ben is there, vadodra is near by so it will work out. I told varun that we will meet after 15th feb. We will visit the school so we can get idea.

Mostly we will take a risk and go to Mitali ben's school :)

**Process of elimination :**
