#### From 25th May to 1st June

- 25th, 26th and 27th went in preparation for the pune trip and other work of office only 
- it was fun to meet other team members at pratham's pune office. On the 28th and 29th we met with a specific agenda to understand 'open educational resources' development project. 
I am going to contribute in content development in nature / environment / climate change domain 

- I visited Ahmednagar to explore Pratham's youthnet work / vocational skilling center. I hope to write separate post about the same.
- Me and Nidhi had a meeting with Aakansha. We shared how we want to implement a 'local khoji' program in Vadodara. She liked the idea, gave some very valuable suggestions. 
She is going to support our work for the next one year. This was the highlight of the week
