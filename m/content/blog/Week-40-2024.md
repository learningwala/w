**Saturday :**

- Saturday was amazing. I spent time with Msc student (child development & life span development) sharing about 'education for sustainable development'. Nidhi also attended the session. After that we visited very famous lab kindergarten of MS university called chetan balwadi. 
Met Prof. Rachna. Me & Nidhi are planning to come more often to balwadi and spend some time with teachers and children. I am very excited for this new unfolding.

**Monday :**

- spent time with children, visited communities. did online meetings - hectic day

- before going back I eat dosa at place where I use to eat when I was working at dharampur back in 2017
I love the sambhar and dosa. I took a photo for memory and said thank you to anna for making wonderful food.
