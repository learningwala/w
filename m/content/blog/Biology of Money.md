## Summary of Today’s Session

### We are not very different from other species.

- Fungi do trading, we do too.
- Animals hunt and gather, and so do we.
- Animals signal for mating and choose the best partner to carry their genes forward. We do that too.
- Animals compete, and we do the same.
  
Our body and brain perceive only a small part of reality, just like the example of a Herring Gull bird focusing on a red dot. We too often see just the "red dot" in many situations. This is why:

- We watch Bollywood movies (which mostly contain violence and romance).
- We eat junk food (caught in the dopamine loop).
- We get alarmed when politicians say another community will destroy our existence – we get triggered.
- We know we can make healthy food at home, but we still order from outside.
- We get influenced by "artificial needs," like the idea that we need to buy certain brands to look cool. These aren’t real needs; they’re socially constructed to benefit companies.

### What can we do about this?

Signals from our DNA aren’t always good for us. Take surgery, for example. When you undergo surgery, your brain signals pain because it perceives it as a threat. But we use anesthesia to stop the pain and perform surgery for a better future.

Similarly, sometimes we need to ignore signals from our genes and think:

- Do I really need this?
- Do I really need to compete?
- Is there really a scarcity, or do we have enough?
- Should I accept everything that comes from the past or tradition without questioning it?

Our DNA might tell us to:

- Buy more
- Fight because they’re "destroying" us
- Earn more because we’re not safe

But we need to ask: Really?

### Our Nature Can Also Help Us Grow

For example, curiosity, learning, and creation are part of our nature. So, let’s use that to create things that solve real-world problems. This will give us both money and fulfillment.

## Money

Money isn’t inherently bad. It’s a system, a mutually agreed-upon concept made by humans to run society. However, like any complex system, it has its flaws.

### Why are Money, Status, and People Connected?

Biologically, having more resources means more safety and freedom. Since money provides resources, people tend to respect and give status to those who have it. But this is like focusing only on the red dot – we shouldn’t judge people or choices based solely on money. There are many other factors to consider.

Whether you’re choosing a partner or a career, looking only at money, fame, or status might lead to a downfall. So, think about other aspects too.

## We Give Irrational Value to Many Things and Chase After Them

We place irrational value on luxurious bikes, cars, watches, phones, and houses. They become status symbols, and people work hard just to achieve these symbols. This is completely irrational.

But we can change our status symbols. Imagine if these were society’s new status symbols:

### Signs of a Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise Society

*(Shared by Manish Jain, inspired by Bhutan’s GNH)*

- Walking and bicycling are the primary modes of transport.
- Animals of all shapes and sizes (at least 10 different species) can walk freely in neighborhoods, feeling safe and respected.
- Every neighborhood has at least 100 diverse plant and tree species, including organic fruits, wild foods, and medicinal plants, and the soil is rich with microorganisms.
- People spend at least one hour a day drinking herbal tea with friends.
- Fresh bread is made and eaten daily using freshly ground flour, often two to three times per day.
- Men feel comfortable crying in front of others and are encouraged to share their feelings openly. Daily human touch is encouraged.
- There’s no need for excessive security measures like CCTV, security guards, barbed wire fencing, or high military spending. People don’t have to lock their doors.

### What Are Your Indicators of Happiness?

## What Makes a Good Society?

A good society is where everyone feels respected and has the opportunity to grow.

Today, on Republic Day, let’s take a pause…

The five basic constitutional values of India, as outlined in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, are:

1. **Justice** – Social, economic, and political justice for all citizens, ensuring fairness and equality in society.
2. **Liberty** – Freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship, protecting individual rights and personal freedoms.
3. **Equality** – Equal status and opportunity for all, ensuring that everyone is treated without discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
4. **Fraternity** – Promoting a sense of brotherhood and unity among citizens, ensuring dignity for the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.
5. **Secularism** – Ensuring that the state treats all religions equally and does not promote or favor any particular religion.

These values form the foundation of India's democratic and inclusive system, ensuring the rights and freedoms of its citizens.

## Assignment for Everyone

Think about these questions:

- Why is there such a difference in the salaries of a farmer and a software engineer? Both work hard, right?
- What would happen if we gave the same salary to every profession?

Write a short note about these two questions and share it with us within the next 10 days.

Feel free to reach out to us if you want to discuss anything.

Thank you!
