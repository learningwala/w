#### From 5th May to 11th May

- Whole week went in an engagement thing. It was a complex project beyond my expectation. event management + people's ego management and what not..But I somehow finished it. I want to put photographs here but cropping and uploading is a little difficult when you are updating a website / blog from a local machine. I will put it on instagram. 

- Apart from that I did my first physical session with rameshwari ben children at Vadodara.Â 
- I pitched nature education to one CSR through rameshwari ben's NGO but didn't get a positive response. The person was more inclined towards STEM and career oriented intervention.
- Yesterday I met Amit Arora. He runs an NGO called Paper Ball Education. We have discussed how we can collaborate on the nature education front.
- I went to see Swara's house. It is a beautiful house. Let's see if everything works out. We will rent out that space.
- From 15th Pratham work will start. So I am looking forward for that
