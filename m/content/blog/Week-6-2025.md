#### 1st to 10th Feb 2025 (Saturday to Monday)

This weekly note got delayed because I was busy in prep for my wedding function. 
It was long distance wedding.. 2 days function at Padra (Vadodra), 20hrs train ride to Kanpur and 1 days function there.. coming back to padra.

I am still at Kanpur while writing this. Me and Nidhi will leave for vadodra tomorrow (11th Feb). We will reach by 12th afternoon.

These 10 days have been emotionally and physically hectic, tiring. I will write detail note about it next week.
