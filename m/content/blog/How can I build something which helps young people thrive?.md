- How can I build something which helps young people thrive ?
- What helped me?
- What are the key differentiators which help to achieve escape velocity ?
- What enables people to live a self - directed life ?

if we see youth as change makers, citizens and future of india then we need to support young people

to achieve the skills they need for this rapidly changing world, community and belongingness

think about the 16 year old boy or girl from small city like Vadodara, middle class family

- got typical education from school
- no idea what career options / study options are available apart from typical sci, commerce and arts streams
- no self confidence, very little self worth, no particular interests or ambition
- easily get influenced by advertisements and media. No critical thinking lens

In my journey what are the differentiators ?

the foundation is same but,

I got the opportunity to work on real life projects
I met people + spaces who don't judge, believe in you and give you the platform. Which ultimately become my tribe / community

How can I create this for friends and peers in Vadodara and my hometown Padra ?

Can project based learning become a starting point ?

Do one research / making / solving/entrepreneurship project around your city. Your questions, your ideas.

I will connect you with subject matter expert, will fund your project, will connect you with further opportunity  (internship / course / job / funding / learning)

This gives you non judgemental space, self confidence, you work in team, express yourself creatively and much more.

after the project done you becomes part of khoji community and keep doing interesting stuff

we will try to guide you for career opportunity, other learning opportunities

Local khoji is a distillation of ideas which I have been dreaming of for years. 
Give unconventional, transformative learning experience to children.

This is not a CSR project / Not a NGO, it is just an initiative. I am very much open for collaboration
I am ready to share all my learnings / ideas / support  if you want to start local khoji at your town, your org, your school, your community. It can fit in your existing programs, curriculum and timetables.
