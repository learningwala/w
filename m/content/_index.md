Hi, This is Mihir aka learningwala.

**I am an Educator, Writer & [Earth Educator Fellow 23'](https://www.youcan.in/earth-edu)** 

(*supported by [YouCAN](https://www.youcan.in/) & [National Geographic Society](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/society/)*)

I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults, through experiential methodologies.

When I'm not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my 'learning experiments'.

**Welcome to my small space on the internet.**

This site serves as a portfolio of my [work](/facilitation), where I also share my [writings](/writings) (*Educational Writing, Classroom Experinces*) and [blog](/tags/learning-resources/) (*Short notes on life & learning*).
