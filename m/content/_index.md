Hi, This is Mihir aka learningwala.

**I am an Educator, Writer & [Earth Educator Fellow 23'](https://www.youcan.in/earth-edu)** 

I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults.

When I'm not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my 'learning experiments'.
