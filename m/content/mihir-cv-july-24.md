## Summary

I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults through Project based experiential methodology.

I believe that sharing one’s passion, providing reflective tools to children, and fostering an environment for dialogue and self-directed learning can be truly transformative.

**I am interested in :**

* Nature / Climate Education,
* Interdisiplinary Project based - Experiential Learning
* Dialogue based - self directed learning
* Mentoring teenagers for portflio making & designing learning journies
* Citizen science - open data - civic engagement projects,
* Creative writing - art - theatre - design and technology
* With decade of experience I consult for a number of alternative educational institutions across India.

When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ‘learning
experiments’ with children.

Music, Long walks, Bird watching, singing and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.
