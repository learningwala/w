#### 19th to 24th Jan 2025 (Sunday to Friday)

- **Sunday :** Mostly spent time in reading weekly notes from different people. I found out [blog ring](https://thejeshgn.com/projects/blogring/) developed by [Thejesh GN](https://thejeshgn.com) where he saved URLs of blogs with weekly notes. He also mentioned some new names of weekly note writers in his recent [note](https://thejeshgn.com/2025/01/17/weekly-notes-03-2025/). I got know about wonderful work of [Adhavan Sivaraj](https://adhavansivaraj.xyz) from the weekly note section.

**Overall mood and other things**

- beginning of the week was nice, I was very happy, calm. End of the week made me irritated, anxious.
It is because of wedding prep going on at home.
- I am looking forward to take session with our sakha fellow on Sunday morning. 
- work side : our bal vikas course team is not active because of various reasons, we need to figure out something together.
