**1. what is alternative education for you? why is it important to you?**

As human species, we are struggling. Struggling to stay together, listen to each others perspective, struggling to think - reflect and be sensitive.

wars - social media addiction - conflicts in relationship with family - community and nature 
I feel  alternative education is important to me because the traditional education system is just increasing the struggles, moreover adding fuel to this struggle.

can we build the environment with vision to develop curious, sensitive, well adjusted, happy human beings ?
For me, alternative education is not about learning new skills or subjects. Those things are part of it but not the only thing.

Alternative education is a space where we have *genuine relationship* with children. relationship like friend / sakha / mitra - there is no fear, no authority, relationship which is growth oriented. 

Where...adult can share their interest, children join them, they learn together. They find resources together. 
sometime children share their ideas and all join.. 
where.. we ask fundamental questions like what is freedom ? what is happening inside us? how can we live together ? How our relationship with nature should be?
where.. we stretch our self to explore our self from the core.. where we bring different exposures and flavors...

for me alternative education is that betweenness of children and sakha, sakha and sakha, children and peers..

**2. What assets/skills/interests/knowledge would you bring to the position?**

**Negatives :**

- some times I seek attention, don't listen or give lead to someone else, my identity/self worth is very much associated with work I do. so if work is not fulfilling for me, it is difficult to be happy. This is recent realization and I have started working to overcome this.
